Java's System Dependant Process Utils.
===========

Project of a library dedicated to performing some specific operations on
processes, namely running them in queues as one process, running them
with elevation or terminating existing processes.

History
-----------

Project was created during development of an Autoupdater project for Nokia
Siemens Networks, when amount of operations on processes grow up, making
it reasonable to dedicate whole library, that would handle them.

It's created from the scratch by Mateusz Kubuszok, and though it's still
in an early development, it can already be used for creating elevated
processes and termination of running programs.
